# stfc_work

a repository with all the code written during my work at stfc


-Codes for quantum espresso


STEP 1:
convert cif file to QE input file --> cif2qe-scf.in
STEP 2: 
run ecut and k-point convergence



--converting from cif to qe and viceversa
--k-points and ecut convergence --> to do before optimisation for materials already in a database
--geometry optimisation
--scf calculation
--checking for results --> possibly also plotting them

--something to put all in a sequence
